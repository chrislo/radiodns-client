RadioDNS example
================

This code represents a quick and dirty proof of concept implementation of the
RadioDNS services.

The code doesn't currently run successfully because the SRV records associated
with the demo URL I've used don't tie up to deployed services.

If you're a broadcaster and you happen to have a stream that you want to enable
for RadioDNS, please do get in touch and I can take you through the steps - it
would be great to have a working example.
